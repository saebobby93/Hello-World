# Hello-World

Hello there!

My name is Bobby Saetern. I have recently graduated with my Bachelors in Information Technology: Software Engineering.
I have heard about FreeCodeCamp and GitHub and have recently joined, hoping to build and branch my coding skills.
As a full time employee, part time barber, and part time programmer, let's just say coding can tend to be rough! With FreeCodeCamp and GitHub, I plan to hone my skills and finally become part of the Information Technology world.
